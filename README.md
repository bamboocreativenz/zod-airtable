# zod-airtable

Use zod schemas to generate typed and validated data access layers

## Repo setup
### Package manager
We are using pnpm - it is the way
### Turbo repo
We are using turbo repo to have a faster dev experience. This is based on the (non-monorepo setup)[https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/main/examples/non-monorepo] ie no `packages` folder.
### Linting and Prettier
These were setup based on the excellent (guidance)[https://blog.joshuakgoldberg.com/configuring-eslint-prettier-and-typescript-together/] from (Joshua K. Goldberg)[https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg]. Checkout the (linting-typescript-in-2023 repo)[https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/linting-typescript-in-2023/tree/main] for the example that inspired this setup.
